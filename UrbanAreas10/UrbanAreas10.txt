  Description:
    Abstract: After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses.  In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the "urban footprint."
    Purpose: For planning purposes only.
    Supplemental_Information: There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000).  Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accurate against National Standard Codes, Federal Information Processing (FIPS) and the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) at the 100% level for the codes and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons are tested for closure.
    The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.
    For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table.  For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature.  TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.
  Completeness_Report: Data completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.

      Process_Description: TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database by nation, state, county, and entity.  Census MAF/TIGER data for all of the aforementioned geographic entities are then distributed among the shapefiles each containing attributes for line, polygon, or landmark geographic data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Data downloaded from American Fact Finder. Used the Select by Location tool to select the Urban Areas intersecting the Rhode Island state boundary. Exported selection to its own shapefile. Re-projected the data from GCS North American, to Rhode Island State Plane Feet. Clipped Urban Areas to the Rhode Island state boundary as some areas extended to Boston, MA. 
        Data contributed to RIGIS by the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center. Metadata were adapted, minor updates made to content, RIGIS distribution information added. Credit for primary source metadata authorship remains with the U.S. Census Bureau.
